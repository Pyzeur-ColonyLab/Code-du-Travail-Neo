git commit -m "ðŸ”§ Fix DNS resolution tools and add fallbacks

- Added dnsutils package to system installation
- Updated DNS resolution check to use dig instead of nslookup
- Added fallback to host command if dig is not available
- Added automatic installation of dnsutils if no DNS tools found
- Updated pre-deployment guide to use dig and host commands
- Added IP validation regex to ensure valid IP addresses
- Improved error handling for DNS resolution failures

This fixes the 'nslookup: command not found' error and provides
better DNS resolution checking across different systems."
