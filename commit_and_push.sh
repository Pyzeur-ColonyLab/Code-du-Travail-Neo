git commit -m "ðŸ”§ Fix deployment script for correct workflow

- Fixed deployment script to work when run from ai-core-system directory
- Removed redundant repository cloning logic
- Added directory validation to ensure script runs from correct location
- Updated SSL configuration handling with proper nginx config switching
- Fixed systemd service to handle both SSL and non-SSL configurations
- Updated backup script to handle both configurations
- Improved deployment guide with corrected workflow
- Added proper error handling and validation

The script now correctly assumes the repository is already cloned
and the script is run from within the ai-core-system directory."
